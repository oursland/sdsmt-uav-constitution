# CONSTITUTION FOR SDSM&T UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE TEAM

## PREAMBLE

The SDSM&T Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Team will be one that designs
aerial robots with the intent of taking part in various
competitions, in particular the International Aerial Robotics Competition (IARC). 
The purpose of the team is to design and build UAV's and subsystems to compete,
serve as a platform for high level under-graduate students to develop their skills,
and for graduate students to have vehicle and tasking to bare out research. 
As a byproduct of taking part in competitions, SDSM&T will benefit by becoming 
more familiar to people in the unmanned aerial robotics community.

## ARTICLE I. NAME

The name of the organization shall be SDSM&T Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
Team.

## ARTICLE II. PURPOSE

The purpose of the SDSM&T Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Team shall be the
following:

1. To compete in the International Aerial Robotics Competition and win.

2. To develop new technologies and novel ways of integrating Commercial
   Off The Shelf (COTS) hardware with existing software to facilitate (1)
   
3. To serve as a platform for personal development of skills for under-graduate
   and a vehicle for research for graduate students.

4. To give students an actual metric for success with an achievable goal to develop
   the critical skills of meeting deadlines, budgets, operating constraints, operating
   in a team environment, and develop leadership and self-reliance.

5. To lead by example in competition and grow in prestige by performance in the 
   SDSM&T and UAV community

## ARTICLE III. MEMBERSHIP

Membership in the UAV team is intended to be inclusive and seamless.  The intent
of this section is to give formal definitions for accountability and due process when
necessary.  The intent is not to be a burden on meetings or a tool for divisiveness.
Thus, expulsion and exclusion processes should not be undertaken lightly and only
when necessary.

1. "Meeting attendance privilege" shall be open to all SDSM&T students, faculty, 
   and staff.  Membership may only be granted as described below.  Membership
   may be rescinded due to university disciplinary standing
   or at the written request of one or more of a member’s professors.
   Additionally, non-officer membership and meeting attendance privilege may be
   revoked by 2/3 majority vote of all active members for any reason.

2. "Active membership" shall be granted automatically at the start of the 6th 
   attended meeting unless the officer core wishes to put membership to a vote at
   weekly administrative meeting.  Active membership bestows voting privilege as
   laid out throughout the constitution.  Additionally, active membership is necessary
   to be considered for direct team representation at competitions.

3. "Associate membership" shall be composed of faculty and staff of
   SDSM&T and/or community professionals in mechanical, electrical,
   and computer science industries.  Associate membership shall be granted
   by 2/3 majority vote of officer core.  Associate members will be allowed
   to voice opinions in team matters but will not be allowed to cast a
   vote in decisions.

4. Members are considered to be in good standing if they attend at
   least 3/4 of the scheduled meetings per semester.  Only members in good 
   standing can vote. This requirement should only be observed
   for active membership.

5. Nondiscrimination: This organization does not discriminate in membership 
   selection, officer election or other appointments, or practices of 
   organizational activities on the basis of race, color, national origin, 
   military status, gender, religion, age, sexual orientation, political 
   preference or disability.
   
### Dues

The SDSM&T Aerial Vehicle Team believes that the work put in by the
students is sufficient and will not impose any additional dues or fees
upon its members.  All funding will be sought through other means such
as research grants, school funding, CAMP funding, Student Association
funding, corporate sponsorship, etc.

### Qualifications

There are no basic qualifications for entry into the team other than
a time commitment and intangibles such as drive, ingenuity, and a desire
to excel.  However, the UAV team's mission and competition level is such
that students below a Junior standing will have trouble contributing
effectively to the team.

### Voting Rights of Members

Active members in good standing are allowed to vote on all items explicitly 
granted to them in this constitution. Additionally, members are allowed to
vote on items directed by the president during the weekly administrative
meeting.  Votes in the latter case will be by simple majority unless the
officer core determines unanimously that they want a different requirement.

## ARTICLE IV. OFFICERS

1. Officers must be full-time SDSM&T students in good academic and
   disciplinary standing during their term of office.  In order to be
   eligible for the President or Vice President positions, the
   member must have been active and in good standing the previous
   semester.  Officers must be willing and able to participate 
   in the team through the date of the competition if graduating
   prior.  Additionally, the President and Vice President must be willing 
   and able to participate through the next elections.
   
2. Officers will be selected through a process of being nominated by
   team members, giving a speech to the team, and obtaining a majority
   vote by the team members in attendance of the meeting. All team
   members must be notified at least one (1) week in advance of the
   start of acceptance of nominations for a new officer. Nominations
   will be made in a team-wide advertised meeting and nominated
   candidates will give a short presentation detailing why they wish
   to hold the position in question, how they would fulfill the
   requirements of the position, and why they are qualified for the
   position. After all of the candidates have spoken, the candidates
   will leave the room for private discussion by the present team
   members. The highest-ranking officer will organize the private
   discussions by recognizing those members who wish to be
   heard. After the discussion is ceased and a motion to vote is
   called and seconded, the present members will cast one vote per
   present member for their favorite candidate. The votes will be
   added for each candidate with the majority of the votes going to
   the victor. All evidence of the vote will then be destroyed and the
   candidates notified of the winner. In the case of a tie vote, the
   highest-ranking officer will cast the deciding vote.

3. The term of office for all officers shall be one year beginning on 
   October 1 and ending on September 30.
